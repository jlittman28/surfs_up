## Overview
The decision to open a storefront relies on various external factors. W. Avy is deciding whether to open a Surf Shop and has tasked us with providing temperature trends for the months of June and December in Oahu.

## Results
### Descriptive Statistics
Summarization of the central tendency, dispersion and shape of the temperature distribution

1. The max/min temps are lower in December, which signifies that it is approaching the winter months.
2. The difference between June and December minimum Temps show that surfing sales will be the lowest because conditions will not be as nice as the summer time.
3. The average temps are relatively aligned in June (~75) and December (~71) which a similar std deviation. This could bode well for the business sales through the colder month of December

## Summary
Based on the data analyzed, two months yielded relatively similar results. In order to perform a better analysis, I would suggest expanding the date criteria to include all months throughout that time period. Additionally, since weather patterns could have a material imapct on sales, it would be beneficial to include Precipitation statistics in the dataset for comparison.
